# Reinforcement-learning-Algorithms-and-Dynamic-Programming
Reinforcement learning Algorithms such as SARSA, Q learning, Actor-Critic Policy Gradient and Value Function Approximation were applied to stabilize an inverted pendulum system and achieve optimal control.
Dynamic Programming was applied to Jack's Car Rental Problem to maximize the amount Jack gets by the end of the day, with some Constraints.
